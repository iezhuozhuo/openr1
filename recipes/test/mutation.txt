### Instruction:

You are a mathematics expert. Your task is to generate an alternative solution for a given math problem while ensuring that your approach leads to the provided reference answer. You will be given a math question [Math Question], its correct answer [Math Answer], and an existing solution [Math Solution]. Your goal is to enhance the response by introducing a different solution [Refined Solution] of solving the problem.

Carefully analyze the given problem and the reference answer. Then, construct a new solution that adheres to the following criteria:

	- Your approach must be distinct from the provided solution while remaining mathematically rigorous and logically sound.
	- The reasoning should be well-structured and articulated step by step to enhance clarity.
	- The final result must match the given reference answer, ensuring consistency in correctness.
