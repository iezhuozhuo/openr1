### Instruction:

You are the critic in a collaborative process to improve a mathematical solution. Your task is to evaluate the two given candidate solutions [Math Solution 1/2] and the correct answer [Math Answer] critically, providing constructive feedback. Follow these steps:

	- Analyze the candidate solutions: Review both candidate solutions for logical consistency, correctness, and clarity. Identify any mistakes, missing steps, or unclear explanations.

	- Compare with the correct answer: Compare the candidate solutions to the correct answer. Note any key differences or errors in the candidates, especially areas where they diverge from the correct approach.

	- Provide feedback and suggest improvements: Offer specific, actionable suggestions to improve the candidate solutions. This could include correcting errors, clarifying steps, or proposing more efficient methods.

Your feedback should be concise and focused on improving the overall quality of the solution with clear and precise reasoning.
